# HydRON Constellation Digital Twin & GUI Monitor

Welcome to the **HydRON Digital Twin (DT) Builder and GUI Monitor**, an interactive simulation environment designed for real-time visualization, configuration, and analysis of multi-layer satellite constellations (LEO, MEO, GEO) and their ground communications network.

Developed in Rust using the `egui` immediate-mode GUI framework, this project implements high-fidelity orbital mechanics, attitude control systems (ADCS), atmospheric attenuation models, and dynamic network routing simulation.

## 📶 Key Features

### 1. Tabbed Ribbon Toolbar & Interactive HUDs
* **Tabbed Ribbon Interface**: Reorganizes all controls into a top horizontal ribbon toolbar with tabs: *Simulation*, *Constellation*, *Network & Bitrate*, *ADCS & Sensors*, and *Weather & Stations*. This clean structure maximizes the screen space for 3D visualizations.
* **Transparent HUD Floating Windows**: Draggable, resizable, and toggleable overlay windows displaying live telemetry, ground station capacities, LEO bitrate lists, and system console logs.
* **Textured 3D Globe**: Renders a sphere representing Earth using `earth.jpg` coordinates, projected dynamically based on Greenwich Sidereal Time (GST) to align with inertial coordinates (ECI to ECEF).
* **Multi-Layer Constellation Rendering**: Visualizes circular orbits and positions for LEO, MEO, and GEO segments with configurable visual filters.
* **Camera Controls**: Zoom with the mouse wheel; rotate the globe by clicking and dragging on empty space.
* **Direct Satellite Dragging**: Click and drag any visible satellite directly on the screen to slide the entire constellation segment along its orbit, preserving the nominal circular spacing and physical velocity.

### 2. Network Link Capacity & Routing Simulation
* **Ground-to-Satellite Links (SGL)**: Simulates atmospheric attenuation on laser links between satellites and ground stations using an exponential atmospheric model and slant-path angles.
* **Inter-Satellite Links (ISL)**: Simulates laser links between adjacent satellites.
* **Laser Link Routing Rule**: Enforces that the only active laser links permitted are those pointing directly to the ground (SGL) or those connecting a satellite to a ground-connected satellite relay (meaning at least one of the endpoints in an ISL must have an active SGL connection). Additionally, any GEO satellite involved in an ISL link must itself have a direct active connection to a ground station (SGL).
* **Dynamic Relay Bottleneck & Handoff**: The capacity of an ISL link is capped by the active SGL ground connection capacity of its relay satellite. If the relay's ground connection speed degrades (e.g., due to atmospheric weather degradation at its ground station), the bottleneck triggers a dynamic handoff, allowing satellites to switch to a faster ground-connected relay.
* **LEO Satellite Laser Terminal Budget**: LEO satellites are restricted to at most 1 active laser connection at any given time (either a single SGL link to ground OR a single ISL link to another satellite).
* **LEO Connection Path Optimization**: LEO satellites dynamically select the fastest overall path to ground (either direct SGL or via a MEO/GEO relay) by comparing all SGL and ISL capacities in a single unified greedy optimization.
* **LEO Capacity Overrides**: Inter-satellite links involving at least one LEO satellite operate at a dynamically configured, stable capacity (bypassing free-space path loss attenuation) to simulate advanced laser terminals.
* **Real-Time Telemetry HUD Windows**:
  * **Satellite Telemetry HUD**: Draggable window displaying ECI orbit positions, attitude quaternions, angular velocities, and physical properties.
  * **Ground Stations HUD**: Floating window with real-time throughput data and active links.
  * **LEO Bitrate Channels HUD**: Floating window displaying status and live speed values for LEO active paths.
  * **System Console Logs HUD**: Floating system logs showing routing notifications.
  * **Ground Station Aggregate Throughput**: Live graphs showing station-by-station and total network aggregate data rates.

### 3. Simulation & Time Control
* **Play / Pause**: Toggle real-time propagation.
* **Time Warp Slider**: Accelerate or decelerate simulation time dynamically (from -50x to +50x).
* **System Reset**: Restore the simulation and constellations to initial values specified in `config.toml`.

### 4. Noise & Disturbance Injection (ADCS)
* **Active Attitude Kinematics**: Simulates reaction wheels and magnetorquers stabilizing the satellites.
* **Disturbance Injector**: Inject a 3-axis torque disturbance vector ($T_x, T_y, T_z$) to observe how the ADCS algorithm stabilizes the satellite bus.
* **Sensor Noise Configurations**: Configure noise levels for Gyro, Magnetometer, Sun Sensor, and Star Tracker dynamically.

### 5. 24h CSV Exporter
* Run a full 24-hour simulation sequence using the current configuration and export the results to a CSV file detailing ground station throughputs, link counts, and overall network data rate.

## 🛠 Architectural & Mathematical Modeling

### 1. Orbital Mechanics
Satellite orbits are propagated using a **Runge-Kutta 4th-order (RK4)** numerical integrator. The acceleration model incorporates:
* **Two-Body Gravity**: Standard Newtonian gravity around Earth ($\mu$).
* **J2 Oblateness Perturbation**: Accurately models the Earth's non-spherical mass distribution.
* **Atmospheric Drag**: Applied to LEO and lower MEO satellites using an exponential atmospheric density model ($\rho(h)$) and drag coefficient $C_d$.
* **Solar Radiation Pressure (SRP)**: Solar pressure model based on the sun vector and reflectivity coefficient $C_r$.

### 2. Spacecraft Attitude Dynamics & ADCS
Attitude is represented using quaternions $q = [\eta, \epsilon_1, \epsilon_2, \epsilon_3]$ to avoid gimbal lock:
* **Kinematics**: Rotational kinematics integrated via quaternion updates.
* **Stabilization**: Employs reaction wheel torques ($T_{rw}$) and magnetorquer control dipole commands ($m_{mtq}$) interacting with Earth's magnetic field ($B$).

### 3. Laser Link Capacity
Networking bandwidth uses a custom range-based capacity model:
$$C = C_{max} \cdot \left(\frac{d_{ref}}{d}\right)^2 \cdot \alpha_{atmos}$$
Where:
* $C_{max}$ is the dynamic satellite maximum capacity configured in the GUI.
* $d_{ref}$ is the reference link distance.
* $d$ is the actual distance between nodes.
* $\alpha_{atmos}$ is the atmospheric attenuation coefficient (only for SGL, based on local station weather states and slant path length).

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* Rust compiler (MSRV 1.70+ recommended)
* Cargo package manager

### Building and Running

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alcio313/hydronTwin.git
   cd hydronTwin
   ```
2. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release

## ⚙ Configuration (`config.toml`)

The application loads its default parameters from a `config.toml` file in the root directory. You can edit this file to configure:
* **Constellations**: Number of satellites, nominal altitudes, orbital inclinations, RAANs, and satellite mass/areas.
* **Ground Stations**: Geographical coordinates (latitude, longitude, altitude) and capacity limits.
* **Atmosphere**: Transition matrices for Markov weather state models and laser extinction values.
* **Environment Constants**: Earth gravity parameters, J2 coefficient, SRP constants, and atmospheric scale heights.
